# React Task Manager

A robust, persistent To-Do application built with React. This project demonstrates full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality, custom hooks, and modern state management patterns.

##  Features

* **CRUD Operations:** Users can add, view, edit, and delete tasks.
* **Persistent Data:** Tasks are saved to the browser's Local Storage, so data is never lost on refresh.
* **Inline Editing:** Double-click or click "Edit" to modify tasks directly in the list without navigating away.
* **Smart UX:** Includes "Enter to Add," auto-focus on edit, and empty state messaging.
* **Clean UI:** A responsive, dark-mode interface styled with modern CSS variables.

##  Tech Stack & Concepts

* **React:** Functional Components and Hooks.
* **State Management:** `useState` for UI state and `useRef` for input focus.
* **Custom Hooks:** Logic separated into a `useTodos` hook for cleaner architecture.
* **Side Effects:** `useEffect` used for syncing state with Local Storage.
* **CSS:** Custom styling with flexbox layouts and CSS variables for theming.
